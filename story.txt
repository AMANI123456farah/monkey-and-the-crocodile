once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree, which was on the backs of a river. In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife. One day, the crocodile came to the backs of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered some fruits to him. The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, as he loved them. As days passed by, the crocdile and the monkey became good friends
